I am a graduate student here for fall batch in Applied computer Science.

I have completed my bachelors in 2019 from southern part of India with background in  Information technology.I think My bachelors gave me basic knowledge about the technology  which is not enough to fulfill my Career goals. So I come up with masters.Prior to my masters I don't have any work experience.In this emerging technology data is getting Increased and also became difficult to handle it. I am very excited to learn more about data visualization and data representing tools.Besides My education I would love to listen to music and play badminton.

By the end of my masters I would like to see myself as a database administrater.
